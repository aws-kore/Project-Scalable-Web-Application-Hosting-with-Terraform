This Terraform project sets up an AWS infrastructure that includes a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), public and private subnets, EC2 instances for web and database services, an Internet Gateway, a NAT Gateway, an S3 bucket, and the necessary networking components. The project is designed to create a secure, scalable environment where an EC2 instance (web server) can communicate with an EC2 instance running MariaDB (database server) in a private subnet. Additionally, public-facing services are hosted on the web server while database services are isolated within a private subnet.
